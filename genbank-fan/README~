To construct phylogenetic tree based on 16S from the contig to CAZY abundance data:

1. Find the most recent contig to CAZY abundance data (filtered: For each contig, across all soil aggregate fraction samples, at least one sample has to have a minimum abundance of 5 occurance; merged: with CAZY family abundance, taxaonomy, and hit ID's).

2. Check your contig file (input file) and determine the column number for "hit ID". Modify get_gene_gbk_from_genbank.py line 9 accordingly.

3. For each "hit ID," pull gene information from genbank (This will create folders for individual gene file with "hit ID's" as folder names).

4. Then from each gbk file, pull out accession number/dbsource for the genome using "get_full_genome_gbk.py." (Not all gene were sequenced fully, hence some would not have any 16S gene. This will also create individual folders from each accession number/dbsource.) 

5. Use "parse-genbank2_16S.py" to pull out 16S information from genome gbk files. (This will give you organism names for each gene. To link back to the "hit ID," use "Linking_Organism_to_hitID.py.")
